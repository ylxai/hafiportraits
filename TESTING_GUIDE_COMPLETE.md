## 🔧 **Prerequisites**

### **Before Running Tests:**
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Make sure these files exist:
✅ dslr-auto-upload-service.js
✅ src/lib/dslr-notification-integration.ts
✅ public/sw.js
✅ package.json (with chokidar, form-data, node-fetch)

# 3. Optional: Start web app for API tests
npm run dev
```

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

#### **❌ "Module not found" errors**
```bash
# Solution: Install missing dependencies
npm install chokidar form-data node-fetch ws
```

#### **❌ API tests failing**
```bash
# Solution: Make sure Next.js app is running
npm run dev
# Then run tests in separate terminal
```

#### **❌ "Cannot find module './src/lib/dslr-notification-integration'"**
```bash
# Solution: Check if TypeScript files are compiled
# Or temporarily rename .ts to .js for testing
```

#### **❌ Permission errors on Windows**
```bash
# Solution: Run as Administrator or check folder permissions
```

### **Test File Cleanup:**
All test files are prefixed with `tmp_rovodev_` and will be automatically cleaned up. If cleanup fails, manually delete:
- `./tmp_rovodev_test-photos/`
- `./tmp_rovodev_simulation/`

## 📊 **Test Results Interpretation**

### **✅ All Tests Pass:**
- System is ready for production
- Connect real Nikon D7100 and start shooting
- Monitor notification center for real-time updates

### **⚠️ Some Tests Fail:**
- Check specific error messages
- Verify prerequisites are met
- Review implementation of failed components
- Re-run tests after fixes

### **❌ Many Tests Fail:**
- Check if web app is running (`npm run dev`)
- Verify all dependencies installed (`npm install`)
- Check environment variables setup
- Review console logs for detailed errors
